### wtfm

## Coming Soon

This repo will share my online documentation system, **wtfm**, which utilizes my
(aa_macro)[https://github.com/fyngyrz/aa_macro]
project. wtfm is fully operational right now, but isn't suitable
for public distribution quite yet.

Watch this space.

## About

**wtfm** resides on a \*NIX web server. It is CGI that allows you to
create and maintain online \(HTML\) documentation right on the server,
working in your browser. It is single creator, multiple client software;
by this I mean that document creation is designed to be a private
undertaking by the documentation author as a security matter, while the
resulting documentation itself can and most likely will be shared.

## Features

* Hugely customizable
* Extensive macro capability
* Full access to all of HTML and CSS
* Handles multiple documentation undertakings
* Global (all docs) and Local (current doc) preset styles
* Doc-wide (all pages) and Page-Local preset styles
* Glossary generation
* TOC generation
* Index generation
* Footnote generation
* Endnote generation
* Images
* Sidebars
* Notes
* Warnings
* Cautions
* Forward and Backward references \(multi-pass link resolution\)
