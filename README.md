### wtfm

## Coming Soon. Ish.

This repo will share my online documentation system, **wtfm**, which utilizes my
[aa_macro](https://github.com/fyngyrz/aa_macro)
project. wtfm is fully operational right now, but isn't suitable
for public distribution quite yet. Mainly because I haevn't... written the
documentation for it. :)

Watch this space.

## About

**wtfm** resides on a \*NIX web server. It is CGI that allows you to
create and maintain online \(HTML\) documentation right on the server,
working in your browser. It is single creator, multiple client software;
by this I mean that document creation is designed to be a private
undertaking by the documentation author as a security matter, ideally
via https, while the resulting documentation itself can and most likely
will be shared.

## Features

* Hugely customizable
* Extensive macro capability
* Styles allow global document changes with almost no effort
* Full access to all of HTML and CSS
* Handles multiple documentation undertakings
* Global (all docs) and Local (current doc) preset styles
* Doc-wide (all pages) and Page-Local preset styles
* Glossary generation
* Multi-level TOC generation
* Index generation
* Footnote generation
* Endnote generation
* Images
* Links
* Sidebars
* Note blocks
* Warning blocks
* Caution blocks
* Forward and Backward references \(multi-pass link resolution\)

...plus more
