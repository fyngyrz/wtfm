# This is an all-caps term->expansion definition file, ASCII-only format
# To be used with soyacro.py or similar application
# Each entry all on one line with 3 elements; ASCII characters only, no HTML:
#    ALL-CAPSorNUMBERS-NOTHING-ELSE-TERM, or a single * to indicate component matching
#    A-SINGLE-COMMA
#    Nothing OR replacement for term, ie MHZ,MHz,Megahertz, or component designator
#    A-SINGLE-COMMA
#    Expansion, separate multiples with '|'. Use &#124; for actual pipes.
# Examples:
#    MHZ,MHz,Megahertz
#    AL,,Alabama (USA)|Artificial Life
#    *,R,Resistor
#    *,VR,Voltage Regulator|Variable Resistor
#
# Tecnically, thhe order of entries and multiple definitions does not matter
# here, as the soyacro.py application sorts them before applying them. However,
# for hand-editing this file, it's much easier if the actual terms are in order.
